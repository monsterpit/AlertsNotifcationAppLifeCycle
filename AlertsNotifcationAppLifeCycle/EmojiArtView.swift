// this is the delegate protocol for EmojiArtView
// EmojiArtView wants to be able to let people
// (usually its Controller)
// know when its contents have changed
// but MVC does not allow it to have a pointer to its Controller
// it must communicate "blind and structured"
// this is the "structure" for such communication
// see the delegate var in EmojiArtView below
// note that this protocol can only be implemented by a class
// (not a struct or enum)
// that's because the var with this type is going to be weak
// (to avoid memory cycles)
// and weak implies it's in the heap
// and that implies its a reference type (i.e. a class)

    // if a Controller wants to find out when things change
    // in this EmojiArtView
    // the Controller has to sign up to be the EmojiArtView's delegate
    // then it can have methods in that protocol invoked on it
    // this delegate is notified every time something changes
    // (see uses of this delegate var below and in EmojiArtView+Gestures.swift)
    // this var is weak so that it does not create a memory cycle
    // (i.e. the Controller points to its View and its View points back)
